# TinyAnsys

Hi, here's Luka.
Recently I'm in my final month, and one of my course "Introduction to scientific and engineering calculation" need to do a project to show what we learn in this course.
I want to do a more challenge work, as I am very curious about simulation.
I call this project -- TinyAnsys, it doesn't mean I want to write a new Ansys, it just my goal, I will keep on improving and completing this project.
